It is scheduled to be co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from 1 June to 29 June 2024.[1] It will be the first ICC World Cup tournament to feature matches played in the United States.[2] England are the defending champions, having defeated Pakistan in the final of the previous edition.\n","\n","The tournament will be contested by 20 teams, an expansion from 16 teams at the 2022 tournament. In addition to the two hosts, the top eight teams from the previous tournament automatically qualified, as did the next two teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings. The remaining eight teams were decided via a regional qualification process. This is the first time that Canada, Uganda, and the United States have qualified for the T20 World Cup.\n","\n","The 20 qualifying teams will be divided into four groups of five; the top two teams in each group will advance to the Super 8 round.[1][3] In this stage, the qualifying teams will be split into two groups of four; the top two teams from each group will qualify for the knockout stage, which will consist of two semi-finals and a final.[4]\n","\n","In November 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the West Indies and the United States.[5] A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.[6] The ICC's publicly stated hope is that hosting a major competition for the first time will put the USA on the global cricketing map.[7]\n","\n","The top eight teams from the 2022 tournament and the two hosts qualified automatically for the tournament. The remaining two automatic qualification places were taken by the best-ranked teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings which had not already secured a place in the finals, as of 14 November 2022.[8][9]\n","\n","The eight remaining places were filled via the ICC's regional qualifiers, consisting of two teams from Africa, Asia, and Europe, along with one team each from the Americas and the East Asia-Pacific groups.[10] In May 2022, the ICC confirmed the sub-regional qualification pathways for Europe, East Asia-Pacific, and Africa.[11]\n","\n","In July 2023, Ireland and Scotland from the Europe Qualifier became the first two teams to qualify, followed by Papua New Guinea from the East Asia-Pacific Qualifier.[12][13] Canada secured their qualification in October 2023 after defeating Bermuda in their final match in the Americas Qualifier.[14] The following month, Nepal and Oman qualified after reaching the final of the Asia Qualifier,[15] followed by Namibia and Uganda becoming the final two teams to qualify  after ensuring a top-two finish in the Africa Qualifier. Zimbabwe became the only Test-playing country that failed to qualify.[16][17]\n","\n","(Top 8 teams from the previous tournament)\n","\n","In May 2023, CWI began a thorough bidding process for countries in the Caribbean region and the United States willing to host the matches of the World Cup.[18]\n","\n","In July 2023, ICC shortlisted four venues in United States which included Fort Lauderdale (Central Broward Park), Morrisville (Church Street Park), Dallas (Grand Prairie Stadium) and New York (Van Cortlandt Park).[19] There were protests by the people and officials of the Bronx community against building a cricket stadium at Van Cortlandt Park, after which ICC decided to make a cricket stadium at Eisenhower Park instead.[20][21]\n","\n","On 20 September 2023, ICC confirmed three venues in United States which included Lauderhill (Central Broward Park), Dallas (Grand Prairie Stadium) and New York (Eisenhower Park) for the World Cup.[22] A decision was taken by ICC to build a temporary modular stadium with a capacity of 34,000 at Eisenhower Park of Nassau County in New York and simultaneously increase the capacities by double for the existing stadiums in Fort Lauderdale and Dallas by modular stadium solutions to expand seating, media, and premium hospitality areas.[23][24][25]\n","\n","On 22 September 2023, ICC confirmed seven venues in the Caribbean Islands of Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Guyana, St Lucia, St Vincent & The Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago that will host matches.[26] Jamaica was the only member association of Cricket West Indies which did not submit a bid to host the World Cup, with Jamaican sports minister Olivia Grange ruling out a bid on cost grounds.[27]\n","\n","In November 2023, it was reported that Trinidad's Queen's Park Oval, the country's most considerable cricket ground, would not be hosting any World Cup matches and that fixtures would be moved to the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in San Fernando. Nigel Camacho, the president of the Queen's Park Cricket Club, stated that the venue would instead most likely host warm-up matches before the start of the main tournament. Also, Government of Dominica decided to withdraw its venue, Windsor Park, from hosting any matches of the World Cup citing their inability to complete the infrastructural development of the venue before the tournament commences.[28][29]\n","\n","In December 2023, a delegation of representatives from the ICC and CWI undertook a second inspection of the confirmed World Cup host countries in the Caribbean and host cities in the USA, also finalizing the fixtures for the tournament.[30][31]\n","\n","On 17 January 2024, ICC unveiled the proposed design of the modular stadium in the New York City, named Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, which is expected to be ready by the end of May 2024.[32]\n","\n","Matches : 9 (Final)\n","\n","Matches : 6 (Semi Final)\n","\n","Matches : 5 (Semi Final)\n","\n","Matches : 8\n","\n","Matches : 6\n","\n","Matches : 5\n","\n","Matches : 8 \n","\n","Matches : 4\n","\n","Matches : 4 (Opener)\n","\n","The group stage will consist of four groups of five teams, played as a single round-robin format in which the top two teams in each group will progress to the Super 8 stage.[42]\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","After the group stage, the top two teams in each group will be placed into two groups of four teams in the Super 8 stage.
